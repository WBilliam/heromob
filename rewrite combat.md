combat should be modified for mobile screen
ditsch the building placing format
instead add 4x4 grid after the base 
placement on the grid, creatures can attack on their collumn only
make all buildings to assign creatures to:
    - nests -> spawn
    - wall -> instantly spawn 3(?) of creature to protect it (no respawn)
    - tower -> creature fire its projectile from there (no more tower types, only one tower)
gameplay idea:
    5 rounds (first in 3 wins gets the game)
    each player assign buildings in their area before turn begins
