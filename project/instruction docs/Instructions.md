## Buildings:
    - Upgradable: Can upgrade the maximum limit of buildings player can place on the map
    - start game with a placeable creature building: each building is loading with a timer, each time a new building is placed, the timer resets (maybe put a scaling timer depending on how many buildings are already placed)
    - can have up to 4 kinds of buildings available for each game: there are many more types of buildings but the player can only choose up to 4 types to use in each game, can config in menu before each game

        - wall (can be placed to bait enemy creatures)
